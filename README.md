# geom-vof-init

Implementation of the Surface-Cell Mesh Intersection (SMCI) and Cell-Cell Mesh Intersection (CCMI) algorithms for computing volume fractions by intersecting unstructured meshes. The SCMI algorithm computes volume fractions by intersecting a surface mesh with a volume mesh. The CCMI algorithm intersects cells of two volume meshes with each other.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

`geom-vof-init` is a project that is used together with OpenFOAM. It compiles on its own and links against OpenFOAM libraries. It consists of a library for geometrical intersections between mesh data structures in OpenFOAM: triSurfaceMesh (triangle surface mesh) and fvMesh (polyhedral volume mesh). 

### Prerequisites

List of prerequisites with tested versions in brackets:

* g++   (9.1.0) : Compiler
* CMake (3.13)  : Build system
* gmsh  (4.6.0) : Generation of input surface meshes

g++ and CMake are available as packages or modules on an HPC cluster, gmsh binaries are available for different Operating Systems. 

* OpenFOAM-plus (v1906)

To install OpenFOAM-plus, tag (version) v1906 follow the [instructions on installing OpenFOAM v1906 from sources](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/OpenFOAM-plus).

### Installing

`geom-vof-init` is using the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system.  

Execute following commands to build `geom-vof-init`, once you have installed OpenFOAM-plus (v1906). 

Inside the `geom-vof-init` directory


```
?>  mkdir build && cd build 
?>  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=on ..
?>  make && make install
```

where the flag `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=on` is optional (it instructs CMake to create a `compile_commands.json` file).

Unlike OpenFOAM, CMake will save the `geom-vof-init` executable and library files in the `build` folder.

The next step is to expand the `PATH` variabe so that the executables are found and to expand the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so that the linker can find the mesh intersection library. 

Add something along the lines of 


```
export PATH="/path/to/your/own/geom-vof-init/build/bin":$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/your/own/geom-vof-init/build/lib":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

```  

to your `.bashrc` file, then execute

```
?> source $HOME/.bashrc
```

to finish installing `geom-vof-init`. 

## Running the tests

## Running the applications 
**Prerequisite:** a STL file that represents the interface for which the volume fraction shall be initialized. A consistent inward orientation of the triangle normals
is required. You can use OpenFOAM's `surfaceOrient` tool to get a consistent normal orientation.

### voFoamSurfaceCellIntersectMeshes
TODO

### poFoamVofInit
This application initializes a volume fraction field from a given surface file in an OpenFOAM case directory. The application is controlled by a set of options.
These options can either be set using a dictionary (`system/vofInitDict`) or as command line options. Here is a list of the availabe options and their default values:
* `fieldName <voffield>`: read *voffield* from the 0-folder and write the computed volume fractions to it. (Default: alpha.water)
* `refinementLevel <integer>`: This sets the number of tetrahedral refinement levels to be used. By default, the refinement level is computed automatically such that
    the finest tetrahedra have a comparable length as the triangles of the surface file. Specifying a negative value also triggers the use of the automatic mode.
* `surfaceFile <file_name>`: read the interface from *file_name*. (Default: surface.stl)
* `writeFields`: if given, additional auxiliary fields used for the volume fraction computation are written. (Default: false)
* `invert`: by default, the inside of the given surface is set to one. If this option is set, outside cells are set to one instead.
